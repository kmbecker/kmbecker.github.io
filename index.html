  		<p>Hello! My Name is Kyle Becker, and I am a Junior Developer.</p>
  		<p> Presently, my skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Javascript, NodeJS,
  		Express, and Handlebars. If you're interest in knowing a little more about how I got
  		started in my coding adventure, you can read a little more about me below, or check
  		out the links above.

  		<p>Since I was middle school, I've had an interest in web development. Throughout 	middle school, I independently worked with basic HTML, CSS, and CMS templating 	engines. By high school, my passion for technology grew, and my emphasis became focused on hardware and building computers and finding out how they worked, down to their most basic elements. After graduating high school, I went on to start a degree in psychology and did that for a few years. After a while, I quickly realized that it wasn't exactly the right fit for me and I started work in retail sales as I always had somewhat of a knack with customer service.</p>

  		<p>It didn't take long and I became a manager with the largest retailer in the world. Despite the progression in my professional career, the interest in tech has not faded in the slightest. My friends and family know me as being the one who always is in the know of the latest tech and I could never shake the idea that I was missing out on something that I should have done.</p>

  		<p>Then, I realized after all this time that I should get back into what I had always had a passion for, I should get back into coding since I was so enthralled with it years ago. After all that we have done so far, I keep anxiously waiting to see what new languages and systems come out in the future that I can have the chance to potentially learn. I have never been more excited to see what the future holds, and I cannot wait and see what the future holds!</p>
