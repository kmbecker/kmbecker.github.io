  		<p>Hello! My Name is Kyle Becker, and I am a Junior Developer.</p>
  		<p> Presently, my skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Javascript, NodeJS,
  		Express, and Handlebars. If you're interest in knowing a little more about how I got
  		started in my coding adventure, you can read a little more about me below, or check
  		out the links above.

  		<p>Since I was middle school, I've had an interest in web development. Throughout 
		middle school, I independently worked with basic HTML, CSS, and CMS templating
		engines. By high school, my passion for technology grew, and my emphasis became
		focused on hardware and building computers and finding out how they worked, down 
		to their most basic elements. After graduating high school, I went on to start a 
		degree in psychology and did that for a few years. After a while, I quickly realized 
		that it wasn't exactly the right fit for me and I started work in retail sales as I 
		always had somewhat of a knack with customer service.</p>

  		<p>It didn't take long and I became a manager with the largest retailer in the world. 
		Despite the progression in my professional career, the interest in tech has not faded 
		in the slightest. My friends and family know me as being the one who always is in the 
		know of the latest tech and I could never shake the idea that I was missing out on 
		something that I should have done.</p>

  		<p>Then, I realized after all this time that I should get back into what I had always
		had a passion for, I should get back into coding since I was so enthralled with it years
		ago. After all that we have done so far, I keep anxiously waiting to see what new
		languages and systems come out in the future that I can have the chance to potentially
		learn. I have never been more excited to see what the future holds, and I cannot wait 
		and see what the future holds!</p>

			  <p>Below are some examples of projects that I have had the pleasure to either work on as a team, or independently on. I have thoroughly enjoyed working on each of these projects indidvidually for very different reasons, and I feel that each shows a different skill set that I have available. Below each image, there is a short description of the project, as well as a link to the GitHub repo, as well as a link to the live project, if it is available in the context of that project. </p>
